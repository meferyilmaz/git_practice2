This is an awesome file Ä± added directly from GitHub.com
And now i am about to commit directly to GitHub.com remote repository
This is not something we would do normally
We are just trying simulate a situation where remote repsitory history is ahead of local repository history
in plain english remote has one additional commit that local does not have
